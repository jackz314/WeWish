# WeWish
WeWish

## Motivation
We all wish to accomplish a lot of things. But sadly, most of these wishes don't come true because of a lack of motivation.

## What it does
- It brings people with similar wishes to motivate each other for the collective feeling of "Accomplishment". 
- The user adds his/her wishes in our app.
- The app searches the database for the groups with similar wishes and lets the user choose his/her best match.

## What we did
We build a React.JS Web Application with the help of the Firebase platform to deploy the application.

## Challenges we ran into
- Random quirks with React hooks and components
- Firebase front-back end integration
- Learning new SDKs, APIs, and frameworks

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Seamlessly integrated Firebase back-end and React.JS front-end
- Working across multiple timezones

## What we learned
1. Firebase as a platform to build a React App
2. Learned how to work together as a team.
3. Learned not to give up even when we ran into roadblocks.
4. Learned how to innovate and bring ideas to life in a short period of time.

## What's next for WeWish
1. A mobile application with the same functionality. 
2. Group matching by incorporating Machine Learning
- People with multiple similar wishes have a higher chance of being in the same group
- Integration with other apps like Health/Fitness app for Fitness-related wishes.
